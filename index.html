        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            You have access to a gallery with four images displayed in a single
            row.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each image can be clicked only once, and they must be clicked in
            sequential order (i.e., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and then 4th).
          </li>
          <li>
            When you click on the 1st image, a registration form will appear,
            prompting you to enter your name, email, and username.
          </li>
          <li>
            After successfully registering, proceed to click on the 2nd image.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clicking on the 2nd image will reveal the names and usernames of all
            registered players.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, click on the 3rd image (which shows a dice). Click it a maximum
            of three times. After three clicks, the game will check if the sum
            of all three randomly generated values is greater than 10.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the sum is greater than 10, you'll be allowed to click on the 4th
            image. If not, you will receive a message: "Try again after scoring
            more than 10."
          </li>
          <li>
            When the 4th image is clicked, it will generate a random 12-digit
            coupon code. The coupon code should be styled accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you successfully generate a 12-digit coupon code, you'll be
            congratulated with a special message or image.
          </li>
          <li>
            If, on the 3rd image, you fail to achieve a total sum greater than
            10 even after three clicks, you'll receive a message: "Bad luck" and
            won't be given another chance.
          </li>
          <li>
            All actions within the game must be completed sequentially, and the
            game can only progress from one step to the next based on successful
            completion of the previous step.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enjoy the game and good luck in your quest to unlock the 12-digit
            coupon code!
